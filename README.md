# go_india_stocks_assignment

A new Flutter project using Bloc State Management. In this I am fetching json data through an api and using bloc state management showing it in the UI with certain filters and searching functions or we can say streams.

## Getting Started

Just install all the dependancies and the project is ready to go on your emulator/device.

## How it looks ?
